This is the final version of the Snake Game that I worked on in my Systems Programming class.

Snake1.c is the first version that I created by myself.
The final.c is the one that I worked on with my group mates where we divided the tasks for 4 team members to work on.

I was in charge of the programming the Snake movement, controlling the signals and updating the snake's length upon eating thropies.
