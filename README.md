This is the final version of the Snake Game that I worked on in my Systems Programming class.

I the snake1.c is the first version that I created by myself.
This version is the one that I worked on with my group mates.

I was in charge of the programming the Snake movement, controlling the signals and updating the snake's length upon eating thropies.

In my own version I programmed the entire game but this version is for the sake of working as a group.
